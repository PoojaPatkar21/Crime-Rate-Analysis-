# Crime-Rate-Analysis-
Crime Rate Analysis is a Machine Learning Project. Big Data Analytics and efficient ML algorithms are used to understand the patterns in crime, hence focusing on decreasing the crime rate.
The Crime Data collected from the website of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). It onsists of data of IPC Crimes from the year 2017-2020 across all the states and holds records of the different IPC crimes.

Creating Models using machine learning
1) Crime rate density analysis using clustering.
2) Area crime rate prediction using classification/regression.

Data Visualiztion: 
1) Collecting administrative map data(Shapefile) 
2) GIS techniques are used to plot the model analysis.
3) Displaying statistical data using graphical format
